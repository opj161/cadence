The Comments Editor API focuses on the client-side interactions for managing comments within the editor, enabling direct manipulation and customization of comment threads.

For server-side operations, use the [Comments REST API](/comments/integrate/rest-api) to manage thread and comments outside the editor.

editor.commands.setThread({
  content: 'This is a new thread',
  data: { authorId: '123' },
  commentData: { authorId: '123' },
})
```

### removeThread( id, deleteThread )

Deletes a thread with the given ID. If no ID is provided, the thread at the current selection will be deleted. If `deleteThread` is set to `true`, the thread will also be deleted from the Yjs document.

```js
editor.commands.removeThread({

  deleteThread: true,
})
```

Selects a thread with the specified ID. If `selectAround` is set to `true`, the editor will create a selection range spanning the entire thread.

  id: '101',
  selectAround: true,
})
```

### unselectThread()

})
```

})
```
