  description: How to provide extra context to the LLM to improve the results of the AI Suggestion extension.

When you [generate suggestions with Tiptap Content AI cloud](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/use-with-content-ai-cloud), the following information is sent to the LLM:

- The editor's content.
- The extension's [rules](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/features/define-rules).
- The `context` option (if provided).

The `context` option is an optional string property that can be used to provide extra information to the LLM. This information will be added to the prompt. It is global, so it will be used with all rules.

## Configuring the Context's Initial Value

You can provide an intial value of the context in the extension's config.

```ts
AiSuggestion.configure({
  context: 'The tone should be formal and professional.',
})
```

## Updating the Context

You can update the value of the context at any time with the `setAiSuggestionContext` command. This is useful if you want to change the context based on user input or other application-specific logic.

```ts
const newContext = 'The tone should be informal and friendly.'
editor.commands.setAiSuggestionContext(newContext)
```

This command will not automatically reload the suggestions. You need to call the `loadAiSuggestions` command to update the suggestions based on the new context. A common pattern is to chain the two commands together.

```ts
editor.chain().setAiSuggestionContext(newContext).loadAiSuggestions().run()
```

To clear the context, set it to `null`.

```ts
editor.commands.setAiSuggestionContext(null)
```

## Reading the Current Context

You can access the current value of the context with the `context` storage property.

```ts
const currentContext = editor.extensionStorage.aiSuggestion.context
```
