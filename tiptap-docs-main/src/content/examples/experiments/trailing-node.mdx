The Trailing Node extension automatically appends an invisible node at the end of the document. This is useful for purposes like adding a consistent footer or signature.

In the example shown here, the trailing node is left empty to enable you to place your caret behind the code block.

Since this extension is **not yet published officially**, you may need to copy the source code and create your own extension.

<CodeDemo path="/Experiments/TrailingNode" />

### Configure behavior
In this example, when text is entered in the last node, the system does not automatically create a new trailing node. This behavior is configurable. The relevant configuration can be implemented within the addOptions() method as follows:

```js
addOptions() {
    return {
        node: 'paragraph',
        notAfter: ['paragraph'],
    };
}
```

## Notes

- **Not published**: This extension does not have a published package yet. You may need to copy the source code and create your own extension.
- **Experiment**: This extension is an experiment and not yet supported or maintained.
- This is currently using an actual node - would be better to use a decoration in the future so the document is not changed
