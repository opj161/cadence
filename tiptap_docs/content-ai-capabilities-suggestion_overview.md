How It Works
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI Suggestion extension uses Tiptap Cloud's OpenAI models (or your custom backend) to generate proofreading suggestions from your rules and the editor's content. The extension covers both the client and server-side implementations. Here is the user experience:

1.  When the editor loads, the AI Suggestion extension generates suggestions based on its initial content and rules.
2.  If the user edits the rules or content, the extension's suggestions are updated in real-time.
3.  The user can review and accept suggestions, or reject them.
4.  When a suggestion is accepted, the editor's content is updated with the new text.
