This guide will get you started with collaborative editing in the Tiptap Editor. If you're already using Tiptap Editor, feel free to skip ahead to the "Adding Collaboration" section.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#install-tiptap-editor)
Install Tiptap Editor

If Tiptap Editor isn't installed yet, run the following command in your CLI for React to install the basic editor and necessary extensions for this example:

    npm install @tiptap/extension-document @tiptap/extension-paragraph @tiptap/extension-text @tiptap/react
    

Once installed, you can get your Tiptap Editor up and running with this basic setup. Just add the following code snippets to your project:

[](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#add-collaboration)
Add Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To introduce team collaboration features into your Tiptap Editor, integrate the Yjs library and Editor Collaboration extension into your frontend. This setup uses Y.Doc, a shared document model, rather than just handling plain text. Afterwards we will connect Y.Doc to the TiptapCollabProvider to synchronize user interactions.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#integrate-yjs-and-the-collaboration-extension)
Integrate Yjs and the Collaboration Extension

Add the Editor Collaboration extension and Yjs library to your frontend:

    npm install @tiptap/extension-collaboration yjs y-prosemirror y-protocols
    

Then, update your index.jsx to include these new imports:

    import './styles.scss'
    
    import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
    import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
    import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
    import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
    import React from 'react'
    
    import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
    import * as Y from 'yjs'
    
    const doc = new Y.Doc() // Initialize Y.Doc for shared editing
    
    export default () => {
      const editor = useEditor({
        extensions: [\
          Document,\
          Paragraph,\
          Text,\
          Collaboration.configure({\
            document: doc, // Configure Y.Doc for collaboration\
          }),\
        ],
        content: `
          <p>
            This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.
          </p>
          <p>
            The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.
          </p>
        `,
      })
    
      return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    }
    

Your editor is now almost prepared for collaborative editing!

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#connect-to-the-collaboration-server)
Connect to the Collaboration Server

For collaborative functionality, install the `@hocuspocus/provider` package:

    npm install @hocuspocus/provider
    

Next, configure the Hocuspocus provider in your index.jsx file with your server details:

*   **name**: Serves as the document identifier for synchronization.
*   **appID**: Found in your [Cloud account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/apps)
     after you started your app. For on-premises setups replace `appID` with `baseUrl`.
*   **token**: Use the JWT from your [Cloud interface](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/apps/settings)
     for testing, but generate your own JWT for production.

### Adding initial content

When integrating the Editor in a non-collaborative setting, using the method shown here to set content is perfectly acceptable. However, if you transition to a collaborative environment, you will need to modify how you add initial content as shown after the next headline.

Incorporate the following code to complete the setup:

    import './styles.scss'
    
    import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
    import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
    import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
    import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
    import React from 'react'
    
    import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
    import * as Y from 'yjs'
    
    // Importing the provider and useEffect
    import { useEffect } from 'react'
    import { TiptapCollabProvider } from '@hocuspocus/provider'
    
    const doc = new Y.Doc()
    
    export default () => {
      const editor = useEditor({
        extensions: [\
          Document,\
          Paragraph,\
          Text,\
          Collaboration.configure({\
            document: doc,\
          }),\
        ],
        content: `
          <p>
            This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.
          </p>
          <p>
            The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.
          </p>
        `,
      })
    
      // Connect to your Collaboration server
      useEffect(() => {
        const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
          name: 'document.name', // Unique document identifier for syncing. This is your document name.
          appId: '7j9y6m10', // Your Cloud Dashboard AppID or `baseURL` for on-premises
          token: 'notoken', // Your JWT token
          document: doc,
        })
      }, [])
    
      return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    }
    

After following these steps, you should be able to open two different browsers and connect to the same document simultaneously through separate WebSocket connections.

For a clear test of the collaboration features, using two different browsers is recommended to guarantee unique websocket connections.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#initialize-content-properly)
Initialize Content Properly

Upon implementing collaboration in your Tiptap Editor, you might notice that the initial content is repeatedly added each time the editor loads. To prevent this, use the `.setContent()` method to set the initial content only once.

    import './styles.scss'
    
    import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
    import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
    import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
    import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
    import React from 'react'
    
    import * as Y from 'yjs'
    import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
    import { useEffect } from 'react'
    
    import { TiptapCollabProvider } from '@hocuspocus/provider'
    
    const doc = new Y.Doc()
    
    export default () => {
      const editor = useEditor({
        extensions: [\
          Document,\
          Paragraph,\
          Text,\
          Collaboration.configure({\
            document: doc,\
          }),\
        ],
        // Remove the automatic content addition on editor initialization.
      })
    
      useEffect(() => {
        const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
          name: 'document.name', // Unique document identifier for syncing. This is your document name.
          appId: '7j9y6m10', // Your Cloud Dashboard AppID or `baseURL` for on-premises
          token: 'notoken', // Your JWT token
          document: doc,
    
          // The onSynced callback ensures initial content is set only once using editor.setContent(), preventing repetitive content loading on editor syncs.
          onSynced() {
            if (!doc.getMap('config').get('initialContentLoaded') && editor) {
              doc.getMap('config').set('initialContentLoaded', true)
    
              editor.commands.setContent(`
              <p>This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.</p>
              <p>The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.</p>
              `)
            }
          },
        })
      }, [])
    
      return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
    }
    

This ensures the initial content is set only once. To test with new initial content, create a new document by changing the `name` parameter (e.g., from `document.name` to `document.name2`).

[](https://tiptap.dev/docs/collaboration/getting-started/install#disable-default-undoredo)
Disable Default Undo/Redo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're integrating collaboration into an editor **other than the one provided in this demo**, you may need to disable the default history function of your Editor. This is necessary to avoid conflicts with the collaborative history management: You wouldn't want to revert someone else's changes.

This action is only required if your project includes the Tiptap [StarterKit](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)
 or [Undo/Redo](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/undo-redo)
 extension.

    const editor = useEditor({
      extensions: [\
        StarterKit.configure({\
          history: false, // Disables default history to use Collaboration's history management\
        }),\
      ],
    })
    

Following this guide will set up a basic, yet functional collaborative Tiptap Editor, synchronized through either the Collaboration Cloud or an on-premises backend.
