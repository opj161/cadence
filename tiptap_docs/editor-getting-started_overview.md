Tiptap is a headless wrapper around ProseMirror, a rich text WYSIWYG editor toolkit used by companies like The New York Times, The Guardian, and Atlassian for their content workflows.

Why use the Tiptap Editor?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiptap lets you create a fully customizable rich text editor using modular building blocks. It offers a range of open-source and Pro extensions, allowing you to configure every part of the editor with a few lines of code. The API lets you customize and extend editor functionality.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/overview#framework-agnostic)
Framework-agnostic

Tiptap works across multiple frameworks, including React, Vue, Svelte, and more. Developers often use the vanilla JavaScript integration to adapt Tiptap to their preferred framework. [Learn how to integrate Tiptap with your framework](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/install)
.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/overview#start-with-a-template)
Start with a template

By default, Tiptap doesn't provide a user interface, giving you full control over its design and behavior. You don't need to overwrite classes, use !important, or any other hacks. Instead, create your own interface within your setup.

If you want to start quickly, we offer a Notion-inspired template as a reference.

Notion-like editor

A clean interface with block-based editing tools that let users create and organize content.

### [](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/overview#add-extensions-to-your-editor)
Add extensions to your editor

Expand editor functionality with extensions that add capabilities or modify behavior. These include basic extensions that don't change the schema and complex nodes and marks that render rich content.

You can start with the [`StarterKit`](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit)
, which includes common extensions.

We provide a range of open-source and more sophisticated Pro extensions. For detailed instructions on using and creating extensions, visit our [extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/core-concepts/extensions)
 and [custom extensions](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/custom-extensions)
 guides.

Additionally, developers can use the [Awesome Tiptap Repository](https://github.com/ueberdosis/awesome-tiptap)
 to discuss and share community-created custom extensions.
