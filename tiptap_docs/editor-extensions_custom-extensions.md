One of the strengths of Tiptap is its extendability. You don’t depend on the provided extensions, it is intended to extend the editor to your liking.

With custom extensions you can add new content types and new functionalities, on top of what already exists or from scratch. Let’s start with a few common examples of how you can extend existing nodes, marks and extensions.

You’ll learn how you start from scratch in the [Create new](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/create-new)
 page, but you’ll need the same knowledge for extending existing and creating new extensions.
